                    <h3>1.</h3><h4>Exploring the Board</h4>
                </div>
                <p>When you log in to <span class="join">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
                <div class="enumeration">
                    <h3>2.</h3><h4>Creating Contacts</h4>
                </div>
                <p>In <span class="join">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
                <div class="enumeration">
                    <h3>3.</h3><h4>Adding Cards</h4>
                </div>
                    <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>
                <div class="enumeration">
                    <h3>4.</h3><h4>Moving Cards</h4>
                </div>
                    <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
